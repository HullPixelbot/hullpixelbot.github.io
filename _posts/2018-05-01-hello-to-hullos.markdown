HullOS is the operating system that controls the Hull Pixelbot. It supports a wide range of scripting commands and can be used to control a robot or any other embedded device. It provides a langauge semi-compiler and interpreter and can persist programs in the non-volatile memory in an Arduino. 

You can find out what it can do, and download all the code from [here](https://github.com/HullPixelbot/HullOS)
