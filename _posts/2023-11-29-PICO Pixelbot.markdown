There is now a new version of the Hull Pixelbot firmware (tentatively called HullOS) which is available for the Raspberry Pi PICO and the ESP32. This is based on the Arduino Uno code. You can find it (here)[https://github.com/HullPixelbot/PICO-HullPixelbot].

There is now also a "Python-ish" online editor avaialble which you can find (here)[https://github.com/HullPixelbot/Python-ishWebSerialEditor]. 

We will shortly be having our first ever "Hull Pixelbot Robot Rugby" event. Keep watching for more details.
