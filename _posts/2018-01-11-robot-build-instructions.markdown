![Pixelbot in perspex]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/perspexrobot.jpg)


The latest generation of Hull Pixelbot is all in perspex. This makes the robots faster to manufacture and we think it makes the finished product that much more professional. There are still some 3D printed parts, but the chassis, wheels and sides are now all shiny plastic. The build instructions have been updated to reflect this design change. The DXF files for the perspex components and the new 3D printed elements will be available soon.

The updated instructions are   [here](https://github.com/HullPixelbot/Learning/blob/master/Build%20a%20robot%20in%20one%20day.pdf).

The previous, 3D printed robot, instructions are also available [here](https://github.com/HullPixelbot/Learning/blob/master/Build%20a%203D%20printed%20robot%20in%20one%20day.pdf).
