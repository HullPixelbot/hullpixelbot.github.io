The HullPixelbot designs and software have been created by [Rob Miles](http://robmiles.com) and the development has been performed in conjunction with [c4di](http://www.c4di.co.uk) at Hull. 

The code is hosted at Github, as is this web site. The site is produced using Jekyll.

You can find the source code for Jekyll at
